INTRODUCTION:

The DEK IN NOMPHONG PROMOTE bot is a Self Driving bot which is programmed to drive autonomously and avoid obstacles with the use of sensors and motors present in the LEGO Spike prime and the Huskylens.

ELECTROMECHANICAL COMPONENTS: The DEK IN NOMPHONG PROMOTE bot is built using the Lego Spike prime. The brief description of each electromechanical component (sesors, motors and bricks) used in building this robot are given as folllows in order to understand the code and functionality of each component better.






Sensors:

	ULTRASONIC SENSOR: The ultrasonic sensor is primarily used for the detection of obstacles and their avoidance. It is attached to the front of the robot.







	COLOR SENSOR: The color sensors are used to detect change or for the comparison between two or more different color.







	HUSKYLENS:The huskylens sensor are used to detect change or for the comparison between two or more different color. The huskylens were in the front of the bot.








Motors:

	MEDIUM MOTOR: the medium motor is the primary driving base of our self driving robot.









	LARGE MOTOR: the large motor acts as a steering actuator in our robot.









Brick:
The spike prime Brick is the primary component of our robot. It supplies power to the robot and controls all its movements and actions. It is the part which stores all the programs neccessary for the functioning of the robot.

CODING:
The programming platform used for the coding of the self driving robot is Lego spike prime. Many programs were combined using My Block Builder. 
	PYTHON
